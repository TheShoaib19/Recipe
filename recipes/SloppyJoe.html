        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A Sloppy Joe is a sandwich consisting of ground beef and onions in 
            a tomato-based sauce served on a hamburger bun.</p>
        <p>sandwich likely originated in Sioux City, Iowa in the 1930s. According to 
            legend, the "loose meat sandwich" was the creation of a cook named Joe.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul id="ing" class="Ingredients">
            <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
            <li>¼ cup chopped onion</li>
            <li>¼ cup chopped green bell pepper</li>
            <li>¾ cup ketchup, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon yellow mustard, or to taste</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>6 hamburger buns, split</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir lean ground beef in 
                the hot skillet until some of the fat starts to render, 3 to 4 minutes. Add 
                onion and bell pepper; continue to cook until vegetables have softened and 
                beef is cooked through, 3 to 5 more minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in ketchup, brown sugar, mustard, and garlic powder; season with salt 
                and pepper. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Divide meat mixture evenly among hamburger buns.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Tip</h3>
        <p>If using ground beef with a higher fat content than lean, be sure to drain it 
            before starting Step 2.</p>
